## Deployment to Netlify

### ⚠️ Important: Updating Your CSV

When you update `scores_processed.csv`, you need to redeploy for changes to show. See **QUICK_UPDATE.md** for the easiest ways to do this!

**Quick Summary:**

- **Fast**: Use Netlify CLI (`netlify deploy --prod`)
- **Simple**: Drag & drop folder to Netlify dashboard

### Option 1: Deploy via Netlify UI (Initial Setup)

1. **Create a Netlify account** (if you don't have one)

   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**
   - Log in to Netlify
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Connect your Git provider
   - Select your repository
   - Netlify will auto-detect settings (no build command needed)
   - Click "Deploy site"

3. **Your site is live!**
   - Netlify will give you a URL like `your-site-name.netlify.app`
   - You can customize the domain name in site settings

4. **Updating CSV is now automatic!**
   - Just update `scores_processed.csv` locally
   - Run: `git add scores_processed.csv && git commit -m "Update scores" && git push`

## Customization

### Update CSV Data

```

### Change Colors

Edit the CSS variables in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #6366f1;    /* Change primary color */
    --secondary-color: #8b5cf6;  /* Change secondary color */
    --background: #0f172a;       /* Change background */

    --danger: #ef4444;           /* Negative stats color */
}
```

### Adjust Minimum Games Filter

In `script.js`, you can change the minimum games required to appear in stats:

```javascript
// In displayTeammateStats function
const teammates = statsProcessor.getTeammateStats(2); // Change 2 to your desired minimum
```
